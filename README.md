**## ⏳ FocusX:**
“The Pomodoro timer for computer gremlins who **‘accidentally’** code for 7 hours straight, forget to blink.”

Yo, listen up! Computers are becoming just as addictive as phones — maybe even worse.
FocusX is here to help you fight back: take breaks, stretch it out, then dive back into deep work.

If you want to go full hardcore, pair FocusX with Cold Turkey Blocker.

**FocusX** = your discipline timer + lockdown assistant + sleep deprivation assistant.

**Cold Turkey** = blocks the apps & sites you know you can’t resist without mercy. 

Together? You're a productivity superhero.
Chill when it’s break time, focus like a monk when it’s not. 🧘‍♂️💻
