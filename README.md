**⏳ FocusX:**
⏳The Pomodoro timer for those who ‘accidentally’ code for 7 hours straight, forget to blink.<br>
⏳For devs who treat hydration and eating as optional features. <br>
⏳The Pomodoro timer for terminal addicts who said ‘just 10 more minutes’... 5 hours ago.<br>
⏳A timer for the 1% of people who don’t need help starting, just stopping.
<br>
Yo, listen up! Computers are becoming just as addictive as phones — maybe even worse.
FocusX is here to help you fight back: take breaks, stretch it out, then dive back into deep work.

If you want to go full hardcore, pair FocusX with Cold Turkey Blocker.

**FocusX** = your discipline timer + lockdown assistant + sleep deprivation assistant.

**Cold Turkey** = blocks the apps & sites you know you can’t resist without mercy. 

Together? You're a productivity superhero.
Chill when it’s break time, focus like a monk when it’s not. 🧘‍♂️💻

**## 🔧 Installation & Setup**

### ✅ Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install python.

Copy this line and hit enter, it installs the dependencies.  <br>
_**pip install pynput comtypes pycaw ntplib tzlocal psutil pywin32**_

If I missed any dependencies, an error will appear once you run the app, just do "pip install [dependency name]", and you're good to go.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** You **must** run FocusX as **Administrator** at least once to enable Hardcore Mode (auto-start, input blocking, etc).
> <br>
> It might take a while before I make a new updated version, so bear with me if I don't respond or make new updates.
> 💬 I am never super active online — just came here to drop this tool and dip. <br>
> Download version 1 if you're not interested in the strict version 2.
